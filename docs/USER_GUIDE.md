## Overview

MyWorks QuickBooks Cost Adjuster automatically calculates and adjusts product costs before they are synced to QuickBooks using the MyWorks Sync for QuickBooks Online plugin. This ensures that your QuickBooks records reflect appropriate cost values for accurate financial reporting.

The plugin works by intercepting product data during the sync process and applying a cost calculation based on the regular price of each product and a configurable multiplier.

## Settings

Access the plugin settings at **WooCommerce > QB Cost Adjuster**.

The settings page includes:

- **Enable Cost Adjustment**: Turn the cost adjustment functionality on or off
- **Cost Multiplier**: Set the divisor used to calculate costs from regular prices (default: 1.65)

### Cost Multiplier Explained

The cost multiplier determines how the product cost is calculated from the regular price. The formula is:

```
Cost = Regular Price / Multiplier
```

For example:
- If a product's regular price is $49.50 and the multiplier is 1.65, the calculated cost would be $30.00 ($49.50 รท 1.65)
- If a product's regular price is $100.00 and the multiplier is 2.00, the calculated cost would be $50.00 ($100.00 รท 2.00)

Choose a multiplier that reflects your business's typical markup structure.

## Cost Calculation

### How Costs Are Calculated

1. When a product is synced to QuickBooks, the plugin retrieves the product's regular price
2. The regular price is divided by the configured multiplier
3. The result is rounded to 2 decimal places
4. This calculated cost is used in the data sent to QuickBooks

### Supported Product Types

The plugin works with:

- Simple products
- Variable products and their variations

### Cost Fields Updated

The following cost-related fields are updated:

- QuickBooks cost field (`_qb_p_cost`)
- WooCommerce Cost of Goods cost field (`_wc_cog_cost`) if the plugin is active
- Standard tracking cost field (`_mwqbca_cost`)
- Standard purchase cost field (`_purchase_cost`)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I know if the plugin is working?

Check the sync logs after syncing a product. You should see entries showing the cost adjustment calculation. You can also verify in QuickBooks that the product costs have been updated.

### Can I use different multipliers for different products?

The current version uses a global multiplier for all products. You may consider using custom meta fields and extending the plugin for product-specific multipliers.

### Will this affect my product prices in WooCommerce?

No, the plugin only affects the cost data sent to QuickBooks. It does not modify any prices or costs in WooCommerce itself.

### What happens if a product has no regular price set?

If a product doesn't have a valid regular price, the cost will not be adjusted, and an error will be logged. Make sure all products have valid regular prices.

### Can I temporarily disable cost adjustment?

Yes, simply uncheck the "Enable Cost Adjustment" option in the settings. You can re-enable it anytime without losing your configuration.
